Dear all, 

Welcome to the EpiMed Open Course initiative.

For the two first weeks, we plan to define a common framework corresponding to the main questions that are usually addressed in statistics: linear models.

We propose the following plan
1. First watch two following videos : 
 - Linear Models Pt.1 - Linear Regression [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk2CQITm_eo)
 - Linear Models Pt.2 - t-tests and ANOVA <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF5_btOaCig" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF5_btOaCig</a> 
and at your own pace, digest the various notions
 
2. When you are ready and wish to go into more details, please ask your questions using the mailing list epimed-open-course@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr (english or french as you prefer)

3. We (or anybody who has something to say about the subject) will answer your questions collectively using the mailing list, suggest you more web links â€¦

Looking forward to reading your questions and comments !

We hope that this distant interactive course will initiate dynamic and constructive exchanges focussed on bioinformatics and biostatistics subjects that we are all interested in, and that we will all learn from one another.

Best wishes to you all
